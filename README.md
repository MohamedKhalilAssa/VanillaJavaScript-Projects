# VanillaJavaScript-Projects

This is a collection of small projects (not worthy of their own repo ^^) built with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Each project is designed to help me improve my skills and get one step closer to being a Software Engineer

Here are the projects currently available on the repository:


# 1.ColorFlipper
This project helped me solidify my JS knowledge and have some practice with it.
it has two pages:   
  
  Basic: with each click the backgroundColor randomly switches to one of 4 colors.

Hex: with each click the backgroundColor of the page switches to random colors using the hexadecimal form.

# 2.Counter:    
  
Another simple project to solidify my knowlodge further.  
  
 It has 3 buttons:   
    
Increase:which increases the counter by one.  
Decrease:Which does the opposite.     
Reset:Which resets the counter back to 0.     
  
The Color of the counter changes if the current number is above, below, or = 0

 # 3.Reviews Page:
 This page allows you to look at different reviews and switch through them using the 'Next','Prev' or 'Suprise Me' buttons. 
 This project might be useful in a Product Landing Page which I plan to do later on.
 
 The JS in this is still Basic. I plan to increase the difficulty as I go on.

  # 4. Iphone Landing Page(Basic)
  In this project I made a page showing an Apple product "IPHONE 13 PRO MAX" , I tried to mix in some JavaScipt.    
  JavaScript is used on the icons at the bottom. With each click the phone showed will change and so will the background to match the change.

   # 5. Digital Clock:  
   This is a fully working Clock changing by the second.  
   This Project had me using the date methods and some new techniques I've never used before, even if It's pretty simple.     
   Tools: HTML - CSS - JS
