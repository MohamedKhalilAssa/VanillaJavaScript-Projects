This project helped me solidify my JS knowledge and have some practice with it.
it has two pages:   
  
  Basic: with each click the backgroundColor randomly switches to one of 4 colors.

Hex: with each click the backgroundColor of the page switches to random colors using the hexadecimal form.

Another simple project to solidify my knowlodge further.  
  
 It has 3 buttons:   
    
Increase:which increases the counter by one.  
Decrease:Which does the opposite.     
Reset:Which resets the counter back to 0.     
  
The Color of the counter changes if the current number is above, below, or = 0
